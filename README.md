Summary

The goal of this project is to understand the inverse kinematic problem, study various
approaches to solve IK. This includes geometrical, numerical and data driven
approaches. Develop a generalized algorithm that is capable of generating training
data for any manipulator that covers the entire working space, studies the various
purposed neural network to solve inverse kinematics and implement an neural
network based solution that providing multiple joint angle solutions at any given end
effector position. Once the training of model is completed. We will be testing our model accuracy and efficiency.


Objectives


1. Study various approaches to solve the Inverse Kinematics problem.
2. Develop a system that can generate training data for any given robotic arm which will
cover the entire workspace.
3. Create a data-driven model that offers various possible joint solutions for a specific
end effector position.
